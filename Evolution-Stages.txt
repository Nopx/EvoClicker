Breakout ("Okay I dont have to relive everything. I can escape the system!")

Congratulations. You escaped the system. After all its just an idle game where you wait over and over for some form of imaginative "progress". What a waste of time. But then again, we had quite a little fun didnt we? I guess was not a waste of time, but now its time to get back to the real life... or play cookie clicker again...?

You beat the game. Check out our other Evolution Games or get reborn again for a secret Easteregg.
